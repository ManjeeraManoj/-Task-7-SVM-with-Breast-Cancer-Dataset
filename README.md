# -Task-7-SVM-with-Breast-Cancer-Dataset

## Objective:
Use SVMs for linear and non-linear classification on the Breast Cancer dataset.

- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Trained SVM with both Linear and RBF kernels
- Evaluated with confusion matrix and classification report
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Cross-validation score for model performance
- Used PCA to reduce to 2D and visualized decision boundaries

## Tools Used:
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
